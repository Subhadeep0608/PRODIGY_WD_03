# PRODIGY_WD_03

The objective was to build a classic tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s what I achieved:

Two-Player Mode: Players take turns to compete and try to get three markers in a row.
Interactive Game Logic: The app handles user clicks, tracks the game state, and dynamically checks for winning or draw conditions.
Winning Highlight: The winning row is visually emphasized for better user feedback.
Responsive and Aesthetic Design: Ensures seamless gameplay across devices with an intuitive layout.
This project tested my ability to integrate game logic with a responsive user interface while keeping the gameplay smooth and engaging.
